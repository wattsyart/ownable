A decentralized, zero-fee marketplace that respects royalties.

## Project Goals

* No marketplace fee, ever
* Runs on your local computer, so there is no central authority seeking rent
* Fast indexing of contracts, accounts, and tokens over time
* Optionally synchronizes index data across other running instances
* Executes off-chain trades that follow EIP-2981 (NFT Royalty Standard)
* Executes on-chain trades that enforce royalties through EIP-2981
* Provides related features for working with tokens (archive, rarity, messaging, publishing, royalty adherence, etc.)
